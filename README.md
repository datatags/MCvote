# MCvote
Have you ever been on a server with 15 voting sites and it took too long to click a link, press yes, return to minecraft, click a link, press yes, return to minecraft, ad nauseam?  If so, this is the script for you.  Simply edit MCvote.html in the script tag with each of the voting sites you want to open, and hit go!  All your voting sites should be opened in new tabs.
You may need to change a setting to allow pop-ups for the page before all the tabs will open.
